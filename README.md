This project consists of a console program that allows you to manage a shop and its employees.  
It has a variety of object types: the Shop itself, Employees and other variants that inherit from it, Departments and Warehouses.  
You can register all the shops you want and manage them separately, each with its employees, positions, and assigned tasks.  
The Employee management section has a simple graphical interface menu.

## üõ†Ô∏è Setup
To run the program, it's as easy as running it on the NetBeans IDE console by loading the project and clicking the 'Run' button, or via the Java console.

## üìñ About the project
The project's classes are mostly linked in a hierarchy to use programming techniques like Polymorphism to optimize the program's code.  
This is the class diagram:
